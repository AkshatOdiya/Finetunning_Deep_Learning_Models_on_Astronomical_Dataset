1. Using your selected pre-trained model, simply evaluate it on the test split of galaxyzoo dataset. (We recommend using the ResNet-50 model from microsoft/resnet-50 Â· Hugging Face)
2. Now, simply finetune the pre-trained model on the train split of galaxyzoo dataset and evaluate it on its test split.
3. Finally, finetune the model using LoRA and evaluate it on the test split.
