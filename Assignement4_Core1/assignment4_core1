1) Find a suitable pretrained model, which is feasible to run on your system for the task of image detection and how and what you will use to work with
the said model, (tools/frameworks and such, we recommend using HuggingFace for this purpose). 
2) Find the suitable finetuning method that you feel will be the best for the given dataset, (which you will get an understanding of by reading papers/blogs on fine-tuning).
We encourage you to read more and find various techniques and see if it will work for this case (Don't worry about implementation right now).

3) Optional: Look for other methods that could be better than finetuning, such as ensemble methods. This will help enhance the quality of your output and learning.
